## üîß Features & Usage

### 1. Private/Public Toggles
Users can easily switch between private and public modes using a toggle button. This allows for flexible privacy settings when generating images. The private mode ensures that the generated images are not accessible to anyone else, while the public mode allows users to share their images with others.


### 2. Image History
The extension saves generated images to an image history with extensive metadata. Users can view their past images, which includes details like the type (private/public), prompt used, and timestamps of creation. The history can be filtered by visibility (private or public) and searched by prompt. This feature enables users to keep track of their previous generations and easily access them whenever needed.

### 3. Batch Generator
An AI-enhanced batch generator allows users to run multiple generations in parallel. This feature utilizes custom prompts to enhance the generation process, making it efficient for users who want to create several images at once. The batch generator also allows users to set specific parameters for each generation, such as image size and quality, giving them more control over the output.

### 4. Dark Mode
The extension includes a dark mode feature that can be toggled on or off, providing a comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions. The dark mode adjusts the color scheme of the extension to reduce eye strain and improve readability.

### 5. Search Functionality
A search button enables users to filter through their image history based on prompts. This makes it easy to find specific runs or images that were previously generated. The search functionality also supports partial matches, allowing users to find images even if they don't remember the exact prompt used.
